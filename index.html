			<!--Paragraph of Julie's goals and personal accomplishments-->
			<p>Julie has always been determined to achieve her goal of graduating college. She spent three years studying Fashion Design and 
			Merchandising at the University of Hawaiâ€™i at Manoa before following her dream of moving to Florida to work for the Walt Disney Company. 
			In 2021, Julie became a full-time Cast Member, which opened the door for her to participate in the Disney Aspire Program. 
			This opportunity reignited her passion for learning and motivated her to return to school, where she is now pursuing a degree in higher education.
			Julie's ultimate aspiration is to combine her creativity and innovation to make an impact in the technology field.</p>
